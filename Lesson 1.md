# Lesson 1: Hello World

## Where do I go?
[The Coder School Trinket](https://www.thecoderschool.com/trinket-easy/)

## Let's get started
Let's write our first simple Python script!  We will use a built in function called `print` that will display text you pass to it.
```python
print("Hello World")
```

We can see the text we passed is was sent back to the terminal!  Congratulations you just wrote your first Python program!
